# Ensemble-Based-Multiclass-Classification-of-Breast-Cancer-Subtype-based-on-genomic-profiles
Developed a multiclass breast cancer profiling model using the METABRIC dataset by integrating heterogeneous gene expression and mutation data. Applied extensive preprocessing and implemented gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) with a stacking ensemble, achieving 92% accuracy.
